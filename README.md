# Immersive-Explorer-Standalone
File manager touch-optimized. Immersive Explorer is an alternative to the default file explorer included in Windows (known as Windows Explorer). It is designed to provide an "immersive" experience to the user by focusing on the content rather than hiding it behind icons and large window chrome and borders. It allows the user to avoid opening different applications and switching between multiple windows when doing tasks as simple as viewing a picture, thanks to the built-in viewer.
