# Immersive Explorer Standalone

Immersive Explorer (https://www.immersive-explorer.com) is an alternative to the default file explorer included in Windows (known as Windows Explorer). It is designed to provide an "immersive" experience to the user by focusing on the content rather than hiding it behind icons and large window chrome and borders. It allows the user to avoid opening different applications and switching between multiple windows when doing tasks as simple as viewing a picture, thanks to the built-in viewer.


This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Julien MANICI (https://www.immersive-explorer.com) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with Immersive Explorer v1.72.
